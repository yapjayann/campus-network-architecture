# Campus Network Design Project 
## Overview  üí°
This project focuses on designing a simplified and practical network for a campus environment, where end devices can access a hosted webpage by a server. Using Cisco Packet Tracer, the network was designed, configured, and simulated to mirror real-world network architectures. Key components of the project include studying existing network setups, understanding key networking concepts such as VLANs, subnetting, and device configurations and network security.  The final design is documented in the project report, along with the configuration files and a presentation on the network's functionality and justification.  

**Disclaimer: The network topology presented here is a simplified conceptual design, and any real-life IP addresses or other network details have been anonymized for privacy and security purposes.**

## Goal  üéØ
The primary goal of this project is to analyze and understand existing network architectures used in real-world applications with the use of command line commands such as ipconfig/ping/tracert/nslookup/etc
and leverage that knowledge to design a new, practical, and functional network where end devices can access a simple web page hosted by a server.
This project demonstrates the process of network design, configuration, and simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer.
Methods to keep the network secure are also explored in the final report. A presentation and Q&A detailing the design and
its justification was conducted and received positive feedback from the instructor.  


## Components ‚öôÔ∏è
This project contains the following elements:  
- **pkt file**: A Cisco Packet Tracer file that contains the simulation of the designed network. Cisco Packet Tracer software is required to open the file.
- **Configuration files**: These files include the setup for network devices such as routers, switches, and other components.  
- **Project report**: A detailed document outlining the network design process, including objectives, methods, and results.  

## Notable Concepts and Lessons Learnt üåü
- Network Devices such as Switches (Layer 2 and Layer 3) and Routers
- Wired vs Wireless connection
- Network Topology (Star, Bus, Hierarchal)
- VLANs and inter-VLAN routing
- Classful vs Classless IP addressing
- Subnetting
- Device and Server configurations on Cisco Packet Tracer

## Reflection ü§î
As someone who majorly contributed to this assignment as the group leader, I can confidently say that this project significantly 
enhanced my understanding of networking from a practical standpoint. Firstly, I independently learned how to gather information about an existing 
network through the command line. Before this, I had never considered the inner workings of our campus network. Exploring Sunway's network 
using commands like ipconfig, ping, and tracert allowed me to visualize the network topology and gain a deeper understanding of the design choices 
behind a large-scale Local Area Network.  

Additionally, I was single-handedly responsible for designing the proposed network for this assignment. I realized that designing a network is far more complex 
than simply connecting devices with the correct cables and ports. I spent weeks researching concepts such as IP addressing, VLANs, subnets, and protocols
to ensure we could implement an effective network suited to the case scenario.  

I also took the lead in implementing the network design in Cisco Packet Tracer, cabling devices correctly and configuring components. 
This was the most challenging part, as 2 team members and I spent countless hours, often late into the night, troubleshooting issues with the 
configuration‚Äîespecially with multilayer and Layer 2 switches. Despite the challenges, we successfully connected all devices and accessed a 
simple website hosted on a web server.  

Finally, this assignment helped me develop leadership skills. I took responsibility for planning meetings, conducting research, 
explaining concepts to team members, and distributing work to ensure we completed the project on time.  

While this project was not perfect, as I was a complete beginner and new to many of the concepts, it served as a significant stepping stone into the field of networking. Moving forward, I hope to tackle more complex projects to deepen my understanding of advanced networking principles and practices.
